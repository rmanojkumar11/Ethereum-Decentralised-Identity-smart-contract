TheEthereumblockchainisinmanywayssimilartotheBitcoinblock
chain,althoughitdoeshavesome differences. The main
difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin with regard to
the blockchain architecture is
that,unlikeBitcoin,Ethereumblockscontainacopyofboth the
transaction list and the most recent state. Aside from
that, two other values, the block number and the
difficulty, are also stored in the block.
Theblockvalidation algorithm in Ethereum is as follows:
Checkifthepreviousblockreferencedexistsandisvalid.
Checkthatthetimestampoftheblockis greater than that of
the referenced previous block and less than 15 minutes
into the future
Check that the block number, difficulty,
transactionroot,unclerootandgaslimit(variouslow-level
Ethereum-specific concepts) are valid.
Checkthattheproofofworkontheblockisvalid.
